def remove_spaces(value):
    """
    Recursively removes leading and trailing spaces from a given value, which can be a string, list, or dictionary.
    Args:
        value: The value to remove spaces from. This can be:
               - str: A string where leading and trailing spaces will be removed.
               - list: A list where each element will have spaces removed recursively.
               - dict: A dictionary where keys and values will have spaces removed recursively.
    Returns:
        The value with spaces removed. If the value is a string, leading and trailing spaces are removed.
        If the value is a list or dictionary, spaces are removed recursively from each element.
        If the value is not a string, list, or dictionary, it is returned unchanged.
